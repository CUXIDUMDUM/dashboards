        old mix from me featuring all the releases from Dillinja''s 1994 label Logic.
        So many good tunes on this, and so some diversity (for a label with only three
        releases anyway), from the smooth subtlety of the Deep Love remix to the tear
        out amen insanity of You Don''t Know - it''s all there! \r\n\r\nIt''s only
        20 minutes, so it''s the ideal soundtrack for having a bath, cooking your
        dinner, or whatever else takes 20 minutes, so sir back, download, listen,
        and enjoy a master at his craft (not me of course! Dillinja!)\r\n\r\nDillinja
